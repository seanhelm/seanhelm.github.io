Hello! I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at George Mason University. My primary interests related to computer science include backend web (Python, Flask, PHP) and desktop application development (Java, C/C++). I have published several of my projects online accessible through [my Github account](https://github.com/seanhelm).

My other interest include music production through Ableton Live, intramural sports, and reading.
