Hello! I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at George Mason University.

My primary interests include back-end web application development (Python, Flask, PHP) and desktop application development (Java, C/C++). I will be publishing several of my projects online accessible through [my Github account](https://github.com/seanhelm).

When I'm not spending my time coding, I enjoy electronic music production, intramural sports, and reading.
